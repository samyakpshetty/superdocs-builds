"""The shape of the in-Notion review queue: a database the page owner approves changes in.

The owner's source of truth is Notion, so the approval belongs there too — not in a separate app
they have to learn and log into. Each proposed change becomes a row carrying everything needed to
decide: who asked for it, the text before and after, whether SuperDocs' AI authored it, and any
link it would introduce. The owner sets **Status** to Approved or Rejected; the integration reads
those decisions and writes the approved ones onto the blocks, then records the outcome on the row.

These helpers build and read Notion's property payloads so the client stays a thin mapping and the
fake and the live service agree on one format.
