"""The inbound review as a durable, human-gated LangGraph.

Three nodes — propose, gate, apply — with a checkpointer so the run survives a crash or a
days-long pause, and a real ``interrupt`` at the gate so the human approves changes item by item.
The graph holds only ids and small serialisable data; the review round itself lives in the Store,
which is the source of truth. Nodes close over the service clients, so the same graph runs against
the fakes (keyless tests) and the live services.

Path-changing decisions live in ``_route_after_propose``: nothing to review, or a parked run
(budget/quota), skips the gate — the graph adapts instead of marching through empty stages.
