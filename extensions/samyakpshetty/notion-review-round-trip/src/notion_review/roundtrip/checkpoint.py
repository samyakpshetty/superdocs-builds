"""Where the inbound graph's execution state lives between a crash and a restart.

The review round itself is the Store's job; this is the *graph's* own checkpoint — the
propose → gate → apply position, so a killed run resumes at the gate rather than re-proposing.
An in-memory saver is enough within one process (the demo, the keyless suite); a durable review
that pauses for days needs the state on disk, which is a file-backed SQLite saver keyed by round.

Postgres is the documented scale substrate (``langgraph.checkpoint.postgres``); it is wired the
same way once a ``DATABASE_URL`` is present, and left out here so the keyless path needs no server.
