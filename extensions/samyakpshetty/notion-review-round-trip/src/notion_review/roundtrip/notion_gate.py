"""The approval gate, driven from inside Notion.

Approval is an *operation*, not a screen: ``InboundController`` exposes it, and any surface can
drive it. This driver puts that surface where the page owner already works — no second app, no
extra login, no hosted frontend — and offers each change two ways, because the two answer
different needs:

* **On the line.** Every pending change is commented onto the exact block it would edit, so the
  owner sees Notion's comment marker where the change actually is, reads what is proposed, and
  replies "approve" or "reject" without going anywhere. A reply that says neither is left
  undecided rather than guessed at, and our own proposal card is never mistaken for an answer.
* **In a queue.** The same changes are rows in a review-queue database on the page, with a Status
  field, so a review with dozens of changes can be sorted, filtered, and decided in bulk — and the
  outcome of each one is written back onto its row.

Comments are metadata, so neither surface inserts or removes a single block: the page itself is
only ever touched by an approved change. Decisions are collected by polling — Notion's webhooks are
deliberately not relied on — which is fine for a review measured in hours or days and keeps the
integration to one moving part.
