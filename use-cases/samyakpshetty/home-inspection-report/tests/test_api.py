"""The HTTP layer, against a real Postgres.

Marked ``postgres`` and skipped without a database, like `test_store.py`. `make test-db` runs
these.

This file exists because the API had no tests at all, and two bugs lived in that gap. Both
were found by using the running application rather than by reading it, which is the argument
for the file: every check here goes through the routes an inspector's browser actually calls.
