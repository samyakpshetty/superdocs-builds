* photographs are uploaded **before** the document is rendered, because a finding whose photo

* a job's decisions are collected and sent in **one** approve call, because approving closes

    the first export was stale at +2.2s to +2.4s after `approve` returned, and converged at
    about +4.4s (pdf) and +5.4s (docx).

    Two mechanisms, and both earn their place:

      the same test on a three-paragraph document never went stale at all, so a constant
      tuned on a small report is not a constant at all. Reading the file back tests the
