"""Reading an exported report back, and holding it to what was promised.

The card asks for one thing to be confirmed: that the exported report groups everything
correctly by system. This module is that confirmation, and it works the only way a
confirmation is worth anything — by opening the finished file and reading it, rather than by
inspecting the HTML that was sent and assuming the rest.

It runs against both the offline and the live path, because both produce real files.
