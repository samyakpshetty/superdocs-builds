"""Postgres: the record of truth for an inspection in progress.

An inspection is walked over hours, on a phone, in an attic and a crawlspace, and the report
is assembled afterwards. So the state that matters — the findings, the severities, the photo
hashes and the decisions taken at the gate — lives in a database rather than in a process.

Two things this buys that memory does not:

* **A walk survives a restart.** Close the tab, drop the connection, redeploy the service, and
  the inspection is where it was.
* **Photograph uploads stay idempotent across runs.** A photo's identity is the hash of its
  cleaned bytes, so the URL it was given is remembered and never bought twice.

The schema is applied on connect and is safe to re-run.
