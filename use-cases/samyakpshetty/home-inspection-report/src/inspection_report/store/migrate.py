"""Schema migrations: ordered SQL files, applied once, recorded.

The schema used to be one `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block run on every start. That is
fine exactly once. The second release cannot add a column, because the table already exists
and the statement does nothing — so a deployment silently runs old columns against new code
and the failure shows up as a missing attribute somewhere far away.

This is deliberately not Alembic. Alembic earns its keep on autogeneration and downgrades,
and this build needs neither: what it needs is that a numbered file runs once, in order, and
that nobody can quietly change one that already ran. That is a page of code and a reviewer
can read all of it, which matters more here than the feature surface.

Three properties, and each is a thing that goes wrong in production:

* **Once, in order.** Applied names live in ``schema_migrations``; anything not there runs,
  sorted by filename.
* **An applied migration is immutable.** Each row keeps the file's sha256. If a file changes
  after it ran, startup fails loudly and names it, because the alternative is two databases
  that disagree about what "0002" means.
* **Concurrent starts are safe.** Two API processes booting together take a Postgres
  advisory lock, so one applies and the other waits and finds nothing to do.
